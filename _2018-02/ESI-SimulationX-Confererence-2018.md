ESI SimulationX Confererence 2018

Under the motto "Systemsimulation im digitalen Wandel" more than 170 participants met from November 8th to 9th in Dresden to inform themselves once again within the SimulationX community about trends and new developments in the field of product development and system simulation. For 20 years now, the event has been an exchange platform for SimulationX users from all over the world. The focus is on the presentation of successful customer projects and the exchange of experiences between users, developers and experts from industry and science.

On the first day, the participants gained insights into current SimulationX projects in the fields of automotive development, industrial machinery, mobile machinery, aerospace and energy technology. On the second day of the conference, the presentation of the new release SimulationX 4.0 with new features and application possibilities was in the foreground.

Next year ESI will welcome all SimulationX customers and interested parties at the "ESI Forum in Germany" in Berlin from November 6th to 7th.
